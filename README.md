# CS 166 Final - Probabilistic Image Segmentation for Color Tasks

All of the GMM training routines and image processing algorithms can be found in `gmm.jl`.
The files `final.jl` and `colorization.jl` contain interactive [Pluto notebooks](https://plutojl.org/) that I used while developing the code.
In addition, `seg1.jl` through `seg4.jl` are quick scripts used to run bulk experiments on the input images.
All of the images used in this project are in the `images` folder.
